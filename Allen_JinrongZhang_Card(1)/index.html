      <p class="description">there will be a number of classes you’re required to take, but you’ll have some flexibility even among those general education requirements. Do your research to find courses you know you’ll enjoy, or that at least will complement your chosen field of study. It’s much easier to do well in a course that you like than in a course you feel like you were forced to sign up for.</p>
